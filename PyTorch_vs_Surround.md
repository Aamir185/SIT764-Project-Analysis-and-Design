# PyTorch vs SurroundAI: A Comparative Analysis

In this article, we compare two upcoming machine learning frameworks to identify their usability and limitations.

## Introduction

### PyTorch

PyTorch was released in 2016 and was built on top of another library called Torch by Soumith Chintala, who worked in Facebook AI Research. Since it's inception, PyTorch has seen contributions from more than 700 people on GitHub and is being adopted and used for deep learning by many researchers.

### Surround

SurroundAI was developed by Applied Artifcial Intelligence Institute (A2I2) based in Deakin Univesity. It is an end-to-end machine learning framework designed with the aim to become the only piece of software required to address all machine learning issues.

## How are they similar?

1. Machine Learning Framework

Frameworks differs from libraries in that the former provides certain level of abstraction to the users allowing them to solve complex problems in a convenient way. Both PyTorch and Surround are frameworks which can be used to by users of varied skill set and experience to implement and deploy machine learning algorithms in short period of time.
 
2. Pythonic

Python is the fastest-growing programming language and Kaggle survey of 16000 professional in the field of data science reported that 87% of them used Python at their work place. Having the framework adopt features similar to Python enables it to be easy to understand by professionals who are well versed with it. Both PyTorch and Surround are built using python incorporating object oriented terminologies, making it easier to adopt and learn.

3. End-to-end soltuion

Solutions to machine learning problems are often quite complex involving different stages each of which consumes lot of time and effort. Using a framework to solve only part of a problem is undesirable and might complicate it even further. The good news is Surround as well as PyTorch offer end-to-end solution from data exploration to deployment taking a lot of burden off from data scientists allowing them more time to focus on the applicability of their model and solutions.
