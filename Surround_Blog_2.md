# Surround vs Caffe, comparing machine learning frameworks.

Data is the new oil. Making use of the data around us is becoming increasingly important for businesses and organisations and nobody wishes to be left behind. Machine Learning is a powerful tool that enables anyone to analyse and derive meaningful insights from vast amount of data. But it is not everyone's cup of tea. There are many challenges people face while employing machine learning algorithms and how these problems are addressed makes all the difference between getting a result that has any real-world significance.

## Machine Learning Frameworks

Machine Learning Frameworks are created to address some of the problems data scientist's face and enable them to complete their analysis in an efficient and timely manner. There are many such frameworks available out there, each focusing on a select subset of the issues and providing a wide range of functionalities. In this blog, we will be looking into two such frameworks, Surround and Caffe.

## Surround

Surround is an open-source framework developed and maintained by Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2). More than a framework, the creators of Surround treat it as a philosphy aimed at reducing the efforts between data exploration and application deployment. It is aimed to be used by both developers and researchers and boasts of a powerful command line tool.

### Pro's:
- **Flexibility**: Surround is built with flexibility in mind and it supports the use of almost all the existing frameworks allowing the users to leverage multiple technologies to get the task done.
- **CLI**: Surround comes with a powerful command line tool which coupled with its python library allows many intermediate analysis tasks to be completed in short span of time.
- **One framework for all**: Surround enforces a set of conventions to be followed thereby making sure that it is useful for researchers and developers. It is not tailor made for any specific type of machine learning problem and rather strives to provide support to all types of it which makes it the only framework you need to solve your problems.
- **Platforms**: Surround can be installed on all three major computing platforms, Windows, Mac and Linux.

### Con's:
- **Maturity**: Surround is currently used and maintained by A2I2 and it needs to be contributed and adopted by more machine learners to spur development.
- **Documentation**: Surround lacks extensive documentation and beginner friendly guides that could generate interest in it and increase its popularity and maturity.

## Caffe

Caffe, developed at University of California, Berkley, is an open-source deep learning framework used primarily for image classification. It supports CNN as well as RCNN network designs. The main point of interest in Caffe are the pre-trained models that can be used without the need to code.

### Pro's:
- **Maturity**: Caffe is being used my many large corporations including Facebook and recevies many contributions allowing it to quickly grow and accomodate more features.
- **Documentation**: Caffe has extensive documentation in place along with beginner friendly guides to make sure user's don't drop out during the initial learning curve.
- **Multi-Platform**: Like Surround, Caffe is available to be used at all the major platforms, including Windows, Mac and Ubuntu.

### Con's:
- **Production specific**: Caffe is tailored to be used for production deployments and is not very useful for researchers limiting the target audience.
- **Complexity**: Caffe has been criticised for it's convoluted codes consequently increasing the complexity of the task at hand rather than reducing it.
