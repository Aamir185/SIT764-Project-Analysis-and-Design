# TENSORFLOW..

 An open source end-to-end platform that helps to develop and train the models in machine learning.
TensorFlow provides a interactive multiplatform programming interface that is scalable and more stable. It provides a good visualizations for each and every part of the computed graphs. One of the important feature of tensorFlow is its flexlibity while operating indicating that it has modularity and some parts of it can be made to standalone. It can be installed with CPU as well as GPU supported systems using virtual environment, pip, docker and anaconda on Ubuntu 16.04 or later, macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (no GPU support), Windows 7 or later, Raspbian 9.0 or later . It provides features such as cluster of TensorFlow servers and distributed TensorFlow.  

# Downs..!!
TensorFlow lags in speed and usuage when compared to other libraries. It provides support for windows only with anaconda or pip. It can only supports Nvidia GPUs that contain Nvidia and Python is the only language being supported. It mainly focuses on performance than the production environment. 

#SURROUND AI

It is a framework that is used for serving machine learning pipeline that provides good performance rate. It offers end to end solution with great flexibility and interoperability along with other known frameworks. It does not require any GPU and has higher computational speed.  Surround also provides wrappers around libraries like the Tornado web server for providing advanced functionality. It is built on python using the concepts of object oriented programming. It require prerequisities such as Python 3+  Docker, Tornado and Operates on python 3+. It caters to researchers as well as other professionals. 

#The Differences..
TensorFlow has its own tool for debugging which is called as tfdbg. TensorFlow Clusters are the individual tasks that take part while executing a graph. A server has a master that creates a session and a worker that function on the respective graphs. Each and every task is associated with the server. TensorFlow clusters can be divided into different jobs with more than one task. This helps to distribute the task within different and enable them to work in parallel inorder to save the computational time. Its possible to train multiple neural networks and multiple GPUs. IT contains Feature Columns that act as intermediate between the raw input data and the estimators.

Surround AI platforms have the docker files inorder to build the project as a docker container. It also has a dodo.py file that helps performs tasks like training, batch prediction and testing for a project. IT has several test for catching up the training serving skew.It has its own command line tool inorder to perform many tasks like generation of project and running the code in Docker. Surround AI provides maximum productivity boost to research engineers. In order to provide additional functionality, surround AI has wrappers around the libraries like the Tornado web server. 

#The Similarities..
Both frameworks have a main.py file that provide a single entry point for running the applications. They have a single space for storing the output files, data and the models. A place for data exploration with jupyter notebooks and miscellaneous scripts has being provided. A python libraray that gives a flexible method of running a machine learning pipeline from different situations such as a queue, a file system or a endpoint of http.
