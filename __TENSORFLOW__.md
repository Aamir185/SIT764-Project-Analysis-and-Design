 An open source end-to-end platform that helps to develop and train the models in machine learning.

# WHY TENSORFLOW..? 
TensorFlow provides a interactive multiplatform programming interface that is scalable and more stable. It provides a good visualizations for each and every part of the computed graphs. One of the important feature of tensorFlow is its flexlibity while operating indicating that it has modularity and some parts of it can be made to standalone. TensorFlow has its own tool for debugging which is called as tfdbg. It can be installed with CPU as well as GPU supported systems using virtual environment, pip, docker and anaconda on Ubuntu 16.04 or later, macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (no GPU support), Windows 7 or later, Raspbian 9.0 or later . It provides features such as cluster of TensorFlow servers and distributed TensorFlow. TensorFlow Clusters are the individual tasks that take part while executing a graph. A server has a master that creates a session and a worker that function on the respective graphs. Each and every task is associated with the server. TensorFlow clusters can be divided into different jobs with more than one task. This helps to distribute the task within different and enable them to work in parallel inorder to save the computational time. Its possible to train multiple neural networks and multiple GPUs. IT contains Feature Columns that act as intermediate between the raw input data and the estimators.

# Downs..!!
TensorFlow lags in speed and usuage when compared to other libraries. It procides suppoet for windows only with anaconda or pip. It can only supports Nvidia GPUs that contain Nvidia and Python is the only language being supported. It mainly focuses on performance than the production environment. 

#SURROUND AI

It is a framework that is used for serving machine learning pipeline that provides good performance rate. It does not require any GPU and has higher computational speed. It require prerequisities such as Python 3+  Docker, Tornado and Operates on python 3+
